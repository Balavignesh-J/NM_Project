# Forecasting House Prices Using Smart Regression Techniques

## Overview

This project focuses on accurately predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques in data science. By leveraging robust preprocessing, feature engineering, and smart model selection strategies, the project aims to deliver reliable and interpretable predictions that can be valuable for real estate analytics, financial planning, and investment decision-making.

## Project Objectives

- Perform data exploration and preprocessing.
- Engineer meaningful features to enhance model performance.
- Implement and evaluate multiple regression algorithms.
- Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
- Interpret the model outputs to understand key factors influencing house prices.

## Workflow Summary

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Initial data inspection.
   - Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualizations.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature encoding.
   - Feature scaling.
   - Data splitting for training and testing.

3. **Model Building**
   - Baseline models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso.
